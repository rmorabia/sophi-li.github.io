## Sophia's Website
This is Sophia's [personal website](https://sophiali.dev/). 

Website here: https://sophiali.dev/

My [previous website](https://github.com/sophi-li/website-v01) was inspired by [Hank](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). I modififed the design and content to reflect more of me, but there were some frameworks that I didn't need yet. For efficiency, I didn't want to use the frameworks until I needed to, so I built this second version from scratch. It is much more simple and feels more me. 

My next iteration will include a blog section. It will include [my blogs from Dev.to](https://dev.to/sophia_wyl), and maybe even some longer blogs focused more on story telling. Stay tuned!
