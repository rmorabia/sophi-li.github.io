Back pain? Sore wrists? Sitting like a shrimp? 

Since I now spend a lot of time working from home,  I invested in setting up an ergonomic work space. I also try not to sit like a shrimp to prevent back pain and sore wrists!

According to stuff I found on the internet, these are features of an ideal ergonomic setup:
- Back / lumbar support
- Wrists straight and arms close to your body at 90 degrees (parallel to the ground)
- Feet flat and fully on the floor, knees bent at 90 degrees while sitting
- Eyes level to the monitor 

Here’s my attempt at an ergonomic home office setup:
- [Herman Miller Aeron chair](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/) - This chair lets me raise and lower the height of my chair so my arms can be at 90 degrees (parallel to the ground) while I'm on typing or writing. I also got the lumbar support feature. I scored a great deal for a used one that's like new on Craigslist.
- [Yoga blocks](https://www.manduka.com/products/cork-yoga-block?variant=23736399527994) - I use yoga blocks as footrests so my feet can reach the “ground”.
- [MacBook](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/) with a [laptop stand](https://www.amazon.com/Nulaxy-Ergonomic-Convertor-Adjustable-Compatible/dp/B07YTHMM3B) - I always place my laptop on a laptop stand to be at eye level with my screen. Using a laptop stand has made a noticeable difference in reducing how often I sit like a shrimp.
- [Dell UltraSharp 27 USB-C Hub Monitor](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-ultrasharp-27-usb-c-hub-monitor-u2721de/apd/210-awkh/monitors-monitor-accessories) -  This monitor gives me more real estate and allows me to be at eye level with my screen.
- [Magic Trackpad 2](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MRMF2/magic-trackpad-2-space-gray) - Since my laptop is on a laptop stand, the separate trackpad helps keep my arms parallel to the ground and wrists straight. I also like the feel and functionality of the track pad over a mouse.
- [Magic Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA22LL/A/magic-keyboard-us-english)  - Since my laptop is on a laptop stand, the separate keyboard to helps keep my arms parallel to the ground and wrists straight.
- [Jarvis Bamboo Standing Desk](https://www.fully.com/jarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo.html) - A standing desk lets me occasionally stand while I work. I got the memory controls which saves me 
- Lastly, even with an ergonomic setup, I make sure to take frequent stretch breaks!

## Conclusion
I hope this blog helps you with setting up an ergonomic work setup or at least prompted you to instinctively sit up straight.
