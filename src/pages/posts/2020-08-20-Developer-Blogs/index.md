I enjoy reading blogs to learn and gain insights into different areas of tech. I follow a handful of blogs with topics that range from tutorials, career advice, cool projects, to art.

These are a few of my favorite developer blogs.

## Tania Rascia

Tania has the best JavaScript tutorials. I always find myself referring to her articles. If there's a topic I want clarification on, it's usually already there.

## Dave Ceddia

Dave writes about all things React in a way that's easy for me to understand. He is also the author of [Pure React](https://daveceddia.com/pure-react/), a beginner friendly introduction to React. Going through Pure React helped me truly understand React after a few failed attempts.

## Robin Wierch

Robin creates educational content around React, JavaScript, and web development. My favorites are his React tutorials.

## Robert Heaten

Robert's blog is on programming for advanced beginners. His [Programming for Advanced Beginner series](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/08/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners/) is one of my favorites. He even reviewed one of my projects as [part of the series](https://robertheaton.com/2020/03/07/pfab11-separating-logic-and-data/).

## Monica Powell

Monica writes tutorials on JavaScript, Gatsby, and other cool projects. I always reference Monica's Gatsby tutorials. I learned how to add search to my Gatsby blog through her tutorial, [How to Add Search Functionality to a Gatsby Blog](https://www.aboutmonica.com/blog/create-gatsby-blog-search-tutorial).

## Dan Abramov

Dan explains JavaScript and React concepts. He also runs [whatthefuck.is](https://whatthefuck.is/), his glossary of JavaScript concepts.

## Denise Yu

Denise writes about career advice, learnings throughout her career, and also [runs doodling workshops](https://deniseyu.io/talks/). Her post, [Do you have any questions for me?](https://deniseyu.io/2020/02/04/interview-questions-to-ask.html), is a favorite of mine and came in handy for interviewing.

## Maggie Appleton

Maggie explains programming through illustration. Her website is a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden). One of my favorites is her talk where she explains [React as a potato](https://maggieappleton.com/reactpotato).

## Emma Goto

Emma writes a lot about React and cool projects she works on. I especially enjoy blogs where she walks through her work _process_. For example, [Raising my first pull request to Forem](https://www.emgoto.com/first-forem-pull-request/).

- [emgoto.com](https://www.emgoto.com/)

## Will Larson

Will has written approximately five hundred posts, a lot of them on management and infrastructure. Though I'm not a manager, I enjoy getting insight into the management point of view in growing an organization. He also writes a newsletter which I look forward to weekly. His post, [Staff-plus interview processes](https://lethain.com/staff-plus-interview-process/), is a recent favorite.

Gergely writes about career growth and engineering management. As someone starting their programming career, these posts resonate with me:
