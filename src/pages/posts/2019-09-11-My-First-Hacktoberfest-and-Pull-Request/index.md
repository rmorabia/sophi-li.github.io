I completed my first Hacktoberfest challenge and got my t-shirt in the mail today!

This was also my first pull request, so it was my first time ever getting involved in an open source project. Here's what I worked on, what I learned, and what's next in my open source journey.

## The Open Source Projects

1. [Techtonica Apprenticeship Curriculum](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum) - A free tech training and job placement program for women and non-binary adults with low incomes.
2. [Twilio Labs’ Open Pixel Art](https://github.com/twilio-labs/open-pixel-art) - A collaborative pixel art project to teach people how to contribute to open-source.

## Why I Chose These Projects

1. Techtonica is a mission driven organization that supports underrepresented folks on getting into tech, which is a goal I can get behind! My learning goals also aligned with the content that Techtonica needed. Through my contributions I was able to refine my knowledge on agile, scrum, and minimal viable product (MVP). There’s a saying that you learn through teaching, right?!
2. During [Write/Speak/Code’s](https://www.meetup.com/WriteSpeakCode-SFBay/) San Francisco Hacktoberfest event, I found Twilio Labs’ Open Pixel Art. It is a dedicated beginner friendly project, which is why I chose it. With some help from Tilde, the workshop lead, I made my first open source code contribution to Open Pixel Art!

## What I Learned

1. I always thought I needed to contribute actual code to open source projects. I was wrong. You don’t have to write code to contribute to open source. My first four pull requests were all (non-code) content curriculum for Techtonica.
2. Don’t make a pull request to your own repository that you’ve cloned. I accidentally did this when working on Open Pixel Art. Rookie mistake! Make the pull request for the _actual_ project.

## What’s Next

I’m excited to get involved contributing code to open source projects with beginner friendly issues.
